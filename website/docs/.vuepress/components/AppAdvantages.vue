              With guon, you enter data only once. For example, tasks used to estimate efforts 
              are the tasks worked on during the project. A lead is automatically turned into a 
              project when an offer is accepted. <b>No double entry</b>, never.

            <p class="text-gray-600 text-base px-6 mb-5">
              You can turn any lead or project into a template for re-use.
              Times entered are automatically summed up on task and project to give you 
              accurate real-time insights. Employee contracts, together with team assignments
              and off-times, weekends and holidays are used to calculate project hour budgets.

              in direct comparison to the planned ones. Always easily able to adapt your
